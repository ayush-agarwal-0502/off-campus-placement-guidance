Some people reached me out for guidance on this too, so I decided I should pen down my thoughts 

## Off campus is a funny place.

Off campus is a funny place.

It shatters the confidence of even the toppers on campus placements

I have had interviews where the interviewers have told me that I should probably find better place to go (basically avoid their company)

I have had offers where the startup tried to lowball me by a huge margin from current salary (and then explained me 10 min monologue on why I should join after I rejected them)

I have had interviews where I felt that the interviewer was underqualified (in tech domain) to interview me (ironically this was a director of a company)

I have had resume rejected from a place where I was in contact with people with the team which had vacancy, and the teammates themselves loved my skills, only for the HR to take someone with 4 yr exp to interview, and the 4 yr guy didn't like the salary in the end 

I have seen the joke of a job market where SDE1 and DS1 DA1 positions are asking 2+ exp , and the HRs somehow taking this seriously too.

I have had days where I solved 4/4 q of a test of big company, applied with referral, only to see the position go to a diversity hire (guess some things never change be it on or off campus)

I have even been reached out from Linkedin Easy apply too once XD (The kind of apply we all consider a joke) 

I have seen HRs who claimed my asked CTC to be "already in higher bracket of their budget" suddenly magically increasing their "budget" by 6L when presented with a counter offer (the satisfaction of saying no thanks to that HR tho)

I have had interviews where the interviewer was kind enough to guide me on how to approach certain kinda q

I have seen jobs from very good companies turn out to be ghost jobs (you will see too when every specific date of month you get auto rejected and the same job opens next day, continuous pattern)

...

Basically

I do not intend to give you some magical formula or "study this do this do that" guidance unlike my campus-placement-guidance repo

Rather just the opposite - I wanna leave the message that "off campus is a crazy place"

Yes, it will take 3 months 

Yes, there will be weeks with no interviews and then suddenly a week with 3 interviews. 

No, you need not fall for "comment intrested" , or believe that creepy youtube adv which keeps shouting "80% job market is dark/hidden and give me 1k and I will tell you the things you already know" XD

Just, all the best for your search !

## More tips - 

Your resume isnt even seen by humans or even ATS in most cases, . Job search is not about how qualified you are. Don't take these rejections personally. Sometimes they are even "locality based" - willing to interview only people in same city as office (yeah even seen this behaviour in good mnc companies). Dont shoot arrows one by one aiming at the target - take a machine gun (I have no idea about guns) and shoot a lot of shots all at once - you never know which one will hit the target

## Bot to fill forms fast -

This was genuinely a good bot, helped me fill workday forms fast. Some things still need manual typing but yeah, try it !

## Places to search (Obviously the uncommon ones) - 

InstaHyre - when my senior told me this site, I heard of it first time, but yeah, I finally got job through this only. It works

Alum groups - lots of openings keep coming up in IIT alum groups also - you will see the power of IIT alum groups now (lets hope you don't come to this stage tho, but yeah if you are reading this I guess you are finding off campus). I have had good interviews (till final round) as the alum liked my skills , even when the official job post asked 2+ exp (didnt convert this interview tho, but still thankful to the alum)

IIMjobs/hirist - they allow you to bulk apply - I remember one of these sites had option to tick and apply 50 jobs at a time. Very powerful to start getting calls.
